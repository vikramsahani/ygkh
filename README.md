Using development data of recently industrialized countries to recommend stats for Nepal's own development. 

An artificial neural network is trained using development data (metrics like birth/death rate, life expectancy, GDP, telecommunication, population, schooling, etc) and this ANN is used to suggest development data for Nepal. What this translates to is, based on the growing/declining trend of the metrics like the ones specified above, the aspects we need to focus on for Nepal to follow similar trend is suggested.
